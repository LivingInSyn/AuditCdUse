This program monitors the CD-rom and on the insertion of a new CD, sends an update to a MariaDB/MySql database.

The idea is to monitor how often the CD-Rom is being used, to find out if my company should stop buying machines
with CD-ROM drives

Eventually, a simple GUI will be built to query the database, right now you'd have to do it manually.
